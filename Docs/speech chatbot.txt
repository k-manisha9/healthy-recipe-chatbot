**Speech for Healthy Recipe Suggestion Chatbot Presentation**

---

**Slide 1: Title Slide**  
Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone! Today, we are excited to present our project, the **Healthy Recipe Suggestion Chatbot**. This chatbot is designed to help people make healthier food choices tailored to their specific health conditions and dietary preferences. My name is Manisha kumari, and alongside me is Indrani dey. We’ve developed this project under the guidance of Dr. Soumya Sen at the University of Calcutta.

**Slide 2: Contents**  
Let’s take a quick look at what we’ll cover today:  
- We’ll start with an introduction to our chatbot and the problem it aims to solve.  
- Then, we’ll discuss our objectives, related work, and the gaps we identified in existing systems.  
- Next, we’ll explain the dataset and models we used.  
- After that, we’ll walk you through the workflow, results, and a comparison between datasets and APIs.  
- Finally, we’ll share our future plans and conclude.

**Slide 3: Introduction**  
Many people today suffer from lifestyle-related diseases like *diabetes, **hypertension (high blood pressure), or **obesity*.
For them, choosing the right food is very important.
This chatbot gives recipe suggestions that are not only tasty but also safe for their health.
It uses *Artificial Intelligence (AI)* and *Machine Learning* to understand the user’s health condition and dietary needs.
The system gives *personalized* and *disease-safe* recipes, helping people eat better and stay healthy.

---

**Slide 4: Problem Statement**  
Why did we create this? Well, most recipe apps don’t consider health conditions. For example, a diabetic might get suggestions for sugary desserts! Existing datasets are outdated or lack details like nutrient values.So, we need a system that can *understand health conditions, **remove bad ingredients*, and still give good recipe suggestions using a chatbot. Our chatbot fixes this by:  
1. Filtering recipes based on diseases (e.g., low-sodium for hypertension).  
2. Checking ingredients to avoid harmful ones. 


---

**Slide 5: Objectives**  
Our goals were clear:  
1. **Safety first**: No recipes that could harm users with specific diseases.  
2. **Smart filtering**: Remove unhealthy ingredients and set nutrient limits (e.g., max sugar for diabetes).  
3. **Fallback options**: Even if strict filters give few results, we suggest alternatives.  
4. **User-friendly**: A simple chat interface anyone can use.  

---

**Slide 6: Related Work & Research Gaps**  
We studied existing systems like **RSS** and **RecipelS**, but they had limitations:  
- No real-time conversation—just static inputs like text or images.  
- No focus on health conditions.  
- Nutritional data was too generic.  

Our chatbot fills these gaps by being interactive, health-aware, and precise with nutrients.  

-----
We studied some previous systems to understand their features.

* *Recipe Suggestion System (RSS)* gave healthy suggestions but didn’t support conversation.
* *RecipeIS* used image recognition and suggested recipes but didn’t allow text chatting.
* *Facebook AI Research* worked on chatbots with emotions and personality, but not for food or health.

We found that most of these systems have some missing parts:

* They only take one-time input, like an image or a sentence, and don’t support ongoing chat.
* They don’t change or adjust as the conversation goes on.
* Most do *not consider medical conditions* like sugar or salt limits.
* Also, APIs like *Edamam* do not offer full nutrition filtering.
  That’s why we chose *Spoonacular API*, which gives better control over nutrients and health filters.

**Slide 7: Dataset Overview**  
We started with Kaggle datasets but found them limited—few recipes, missing nutrients, and outdated. So, we switched to the **Spoonacular API**, which offers:  
- Over 360,000 recipes.  
- Detailed nutrient data (e.g., sodium, sugar per serving).  
- Real-time updates.  

For diet plans, we cleaned and standardized Kaggle data using tools like Pandas.  

---

In the beginning, we explored many datasets from *Kaggle*, like Indian Food Dataset and Healthy Meal Plan Dataset.
But these datasets didn’t have enough detail about nutrients or diseases.
So we decided to use the *Spoonacular API*.
It provides over *30 nutrients per recipe*, like calories, sugar, sodium, carbs, etc.
This helps us match recipes with the user’s disease condition.

For our *diet planner*, we still used some Kaggle datasets.
We cleaned the data using *Pandas*, changed units into standard ones like mg or grams, and removed wrong entries.
We also used *LabelEncoder* to prepare data for machine learning.

---

**Slide 8: Models Used**  
Our chatbot is powered by smart technologies:  
1. **Sentence Transformer**: Understands user queries (e.g., “heart issue” = hypertension).  
2. **Gemini AI**: Extracts key details like diseases/ingredients from chats.  
3. **Random Forest**: Predicts calorie needs based on user profiles.  
4. **RapidFuzz**: Fixes typos (e.g., “diabetis” → “diabetes”).  
5. **Pinecone**: Stores user data securely for personalized suggestions.  

---

**Slide 9: Workflow**  
Here’s how it works:  
1. You chat with the bot (e.g., “I need low-carb dinner ideas”).  
2. The bot checks your health profile and diet needs.  
3. It filters recipes using Spoonacular API and sends safe options.  
4. You get a tailored meal plan!  

---

**Slides 10-12: Results**  
In our tests, the chatbot successfully:  
- Filtered recipes by disease (e.g., low-sugar for diabetes).  
- Generated weekly diet charts (like the one shown here with breakfast, lunch, and dinner options).  
- Calculated daily macros (calories, protein, carbs).  

---

**Slide 13: Dataset vs. API**  
Why Spoonacular?  
- **Datasets**: Limited recipes, outdated, missing nutrients.  
- **API**: Huge variety, real-time data, 30+ nutrients per recipe—perfect for health-focused filtering.  

---

**Slide 14: Future Work & Conclusion**  
We’re just getting started! Future upgrades include:  
- Voice/image inputs (e.g., snap a photo of your fridge for recipe ideas!).  
- Support for regional languages and local cuisines.  
- IoT integration (e.g., sync with smart scales).  

**In conclusion**, our chatbot makes healthy eating easy, personalized, and safe. It’s not just a recipe app—it’s your AI-powered kitchen assistant!  

---

**Slide 15: References**  
We’ve built on great work by researchers and datasets from Kaggle and Spoonacular. Thank you to all contributors!  

---

**Slide 16: Thank You!**  
That’s a wrap! We’d love to hear your thoughts or answer any questions. Thank you for your time and attention!

**Closing**:  
Remember, good food is the foundation of good health. With our chatbot, everyone can enjoy meals that are as nutritious as they are delicious. Let’s cook up a healthier future together!
